### Executive Summary
In this exploration, we look at the data from [Motors Trends](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html) magazine collected in 1974 for 32 car models. Our goal is to analyze the potential impact of car transmission types over miles per gallon efficiencty by answering two questions:

- “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
- "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

From the data exploration and completed linear regression, we can conclude that manual transmission cars have a marginal impact over mpg effciency but not strong enough to be seen as the sole variable predicting mpg effciency. Our multivariate analysis has shown that istead, a combination of predictors such as: cylinder, weight and horse power inlcuding transmission help explain mpg effciency over manual transmission alone.

##### Data Exploration and Analysis
The initial analysis will be based on a simple linear regression model with the two variables the question focuses on:

- `mpg`: Miles/(US) gallon, which will represent the outcome in this linear model.
- `am`: the car transmission. In our model this will be our predictor variable, which has 2 possible values: 0 = automatic, 1 = manual. (See point A in the appendix.) . Therefore, transmission will be treated as a factor variable.

Looking further into the dataset (see point A in the appendix.) we can see several variables with levels, therfore, we'll proceed with a quick trasnformation fo these varibales into factors preemtively assumign we will need them for further exploration of our intital model. Said variables are: `cyl`, `gear` and `carb`, and `vs`.
```{r, echo= FALSE}
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am)
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars$carb <- factor(mtcars$carb)
mtcars$vs <- factor(mtcars$vs)
```

*I. Initial Model: MPG by transmission predictor*

We'll start by plotting mpg by trasmission type, looking at the box plot (point B in the appendix), we can see that manuals trasmission has a better impact over mpg consumption.
```{r}
model.1 <- lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
summary(model.1)$coef
confint(model.1)
```
Digging deeper, using our initial linear `model.1`, we can see an increase in MPG for cars with manual transmissions of `r summary(model.1)$coef[2]` over automatic transmission. Looking as well at the low p-value `0.000285` and that the confidence interval does not include zero, we can reject a null hypothesis of no difference between manual vs. autmatic trasmission. However, looking closer at the model, its fit is pretty low as seen through an 
`r summary(model.1)$r.squared` r-squared value which doens't seem sufficient to explain the mpg variability. 
It seems best considering the dataset includes 10 dimensions, to explore if other variables in addition to trasmission `am` have an impact on mpg efficiency.

*Multivariate regression and model selection*

To figure out if other predictors do have impact over mpg, we'll start with a model that includes all captured variables in the dataset. 
We will then proceed with a setwise model to see if some precitors could be inferred as hvaing better impact over mpg.
We'll then conclude with an `ANOVA` comparison of these two models with our initial model.1 that only looked at `mpg` vs. `am`.
```{r, results='hide'}
# All predictors model
model.all <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars) 
# Best model selection with stepwise
model.best <- step(model.all, direction = "both")
summary(model.best)
```

```{r}
printCoefmat(summary(model.best)$coefficients)
summary(model.best)$r.squared
```
From the stepwise model resulting `model.best`, we can see that a combination of 4 predictors: cylinder `cyl`, horse power `hp`, weight `wt` and transmission `am` explain about `r summary(model.best)$r.squared` (with an adjusted r squared of ~84%) of the mpg variance. We can see the p-value for `cyl`, horse power `hp`, weight `wt` are quite significant in their contribution to the accuracy of the model especially if compared to trasmission `am`. 

Looking further at the *Residuals* (see point D in the appendix), we can see from plotting the model.best that:

- The residuals vs. fitted plot outlines data points that seem to be randomly scattered which indicates independence.
- The Normal Q-Q plot consists of data points that mostly fall on the regression line indicating a normal distribution.

```{r, results='hide'}
# Anova
anova(model.1, model.best, model.all)
```
In addition an ANOVA analysis of the variance (see point D in the appendix) with all models shows, that model.best has a significant p-value of `1.476e-05` which validates that additional predictors do have an impact on mpg and contribute to the accuracy of the overall model.

##### Conclusion
Manual trasmission does have an increase of overall mpg performance of 1.80 mpg effiency over automatic transmission, but only when including additional predictor variables to the model that are: cylinder number, horse power and car weight. The variable transmission alone is not sufficient to explain mpg efficiency.
